# 👋 Hey, I'm Miguel!

Welcome to my GitHub! Here you’ll find some of the projects I’ve built while studying at 42 Lisboa. I enjoy solving problems through code and learning something new with every project. Below are a few highlights worth checking out.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 [Philosophers](https://github.com/Migalhassss/Philosophers)
A multithreaded solution to the classic Dining Philosophers problem in C. The main goal was to manage concurrency, avoid deadlocks, and ensure proper timing and synchronization.

### 🕹️ [Cub3D](https://github.com/Migalhassss/Cub3d)
A raycasting 3D engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, built from scratch in C. It parses `.cub` map files, renders 3D scenes, and handles smooth player movement. One of the most fun and challenging projects I’ve done.

### 🌐 [Inception](https://github.com/Migalhassss/Inception)
A containerized infrastructure using Docker. Each service (Nginx, MariaDB, WordPress, etc.) runs in its own custom container. Everything is built and configured from the ground up.

### 🔐 [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Migalhassss/ft_transcendence) *(work in progress)*
A full-stack web app with 2FA login, WebSocket communication, and a mini multiplayer game. Built with a modern stack (NestJS, React, PostgreSQL, Docker), and developed as the final project at 42.

## 🛠️ Other Notable Projects
- **Libft**: A custom C library with reimplementations of standard functions.
- **Minishell**: A small shell with command parsing, execution, pipes, and more.
- **Push_swap**: A sorting algorithm project focused on minimizing operations.
- **Get_next_line**: Reads files line by line using dynamic buffers.
- **Ft_printf**: A custom implementation of the classic `printf()` function.
